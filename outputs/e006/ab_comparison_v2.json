      "method": "Head-restrained mouse VR system with chronically implanted head-plate constraining movements to horizontal rotations. Compatible with multi-photon imaging. Compared place cell, grid cell, and head-direction cell firing patterns between VR and real arenas.",
      "finding": "Place and grid cells had broader spatial tuning in VR than real arenas, but grid cell firing maintained 2D patterns. Place cells were more directional in real arenas. Theta frequency increased less with running speed in VR. Firing rates and theta phase precession were similar between VR and real environments.",
