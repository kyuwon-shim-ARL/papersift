# E002 Executive Summary: OpenAlex Fulltext Coverage Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Analyst**: Scientist Agent (oh-my-claudecode)
**Dataset**: Virtual Cell Sweep (3,070 papers)

---

## Decision: GO ✓

**OpenAlex fulltext search is viable for Tier-1 SOTA filtering strategy.**

---

## Key Metrics

### Coverage
- **48.6%** of papers have fulltext indexed (751/1,545 checked)
- 95% CI: [46.1%, 51.1%]
- **Exceeds 30% threshold** → Tier-1 strategy validated

### Best Filter Patterns
1. **"improvement"** (29.7% recall) — "improves upon OR extends OR enhances OR advances"
2. **"method_proposal"** (26.8% recall) — "we propose OR novel method OR new framework OR new approach"
3. **"sota_narrow"** (7.8% recall) — "outperforms OR surpasses OR beats"

### Effect Sizes
- Method proposal is **3.4x more prevalent** than SOTA-narrow
- Improvement pattern is **3.8x more effective** than SOTA-narrow
- Combined pattern **underperforms** (9.8% vs 26.8% for method_proposal alone)

---

## Critical Insights

### 1. Method-Focused Filters Outperform SOTA Filters
Papers describe new methods (26.8%) far more often than claiming SOTA performance (7.8%).

**Implication**: Use method-focused patterns for broad discovery; reserve SOTA filters for high-precision needs.

### 2. Domain-Specific Variation is Significant
- **ML/CV papers**: 13-25% SOTA-narrow rate (ResNet, LSTM, Random Forest)
- **Methodology papers**: 1-4% SOTA-narrow rate (statistics, bioinformatics)

**Implication**: Pattern selection should be domain-aware.

### 3. Incremental Contributions Dominate
"Improvement" pattern (29.7%) captures incremental advances ("extends", "enhances") better than breakthrough claims.

**Implication**: For comprehensive coverage, prioritize "improvement" over "state-of-the-art".

## Recommendations

### Recommended Filter Strategy (Ranked Priority)

```python
# Phase 1: High Recall (Method Discovery)
filter_1 = "improves upon OR extends OR enhances OR advances"  # 29.7% recall
filter_2 = "we propose OR novel method OR new framework OR new approach"  # 26.8% recall

# Phase 2: High Precision (Benchmark Papers)
filter_3 = "outperforms OR surpasses OR beats"  # 7.8% recall, ML/DL domains
```

### Implementation Notes
- **DO NOT** combine patterns with OR in a single query (underperforms)
- **DO** run separate queries and deduplicate results
- **DO** adjust weights by domain (higher SOTA weight for ML/CV)

---

## Limitations

1. **API Coverage Gap**: Only 50.3% of papers returned by API (1,545/3,070)
2. **Seed Bias**: Analysis based on top 10 cited papers; may not generalize to long-tail
3. **English-Only**: Patterns tested are English-centric
4. **Query Semantics**: OR behavior in OpenAlex fulltext search requires further investigation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Proceed with Tier-1 strategy** (coverage threshold met)
2. ✅ **Use "improvement" + "method_proposal" patterns** for broad recall
3. ✅ **Reserve "sota_narrow" for ML/DL benchmarking papers**

### Future Investigations
1. **API Coverage Gap**: Investigate why 49.7% of papers not returned (access restrictions? API limitations?)
2. **Query Semantics**: Test OR vs separate queries to understand combined pattern underperformance
3. **Domain Calibration**: Measure pattern effectiveness across Virtual Cell clusters (biology vs telecom vs manufacturing)
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Check if fulltext coverage varies by publication year (recent papers may have higher coverage)
